# We Love Icon Fonts

This is like [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts), but for Open Source Icon Fonts. Hurray!

This is not like [Fontello](http://fontello.com/), because you can't generate Icon Fonts here.

Just choose your favorite Icon Fonts and use them on your website. It's really that simple!

## Public Beta

Please help me find bugs and stuff!

## It's optimized for "small" screens
